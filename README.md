# Terraforming Autonomous Drone (GGJ2020)
Terraforming autonomous drone is a game where you explore and terraform the dead landscape around you. Dig the earth to plant grass, plant trees in the grass but make sure to water your new growth each day! You might come across interesting things which need repairing... Your first day will even have real-time weather for your city!
